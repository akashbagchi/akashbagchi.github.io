Welcome to my personal portfolio repository! I created this simple static website with nothing but the basics - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### But WHY?

I already know what you're thinking. JavaScript frameworks like Vue, Next, and React are ubiquitous with modern web development. So _why_ pray tell, is my portfolio using only vanilla HTML? Well that's just the thing. I absolutely love that the web technology space is becoming increasingly more accessible lately, so much so that even the most inexperienced person can bring their ideas to life by dragging & dropping components into their website, or even leveraging AI to do it for them!

I want to contribute to this movement - by
strengthening my skill in the foundations as well as in cutting-edge technologies, so I can one day help everyone bring their imagination to life, without being intimidated by inaccessibility or complexity.

That's not to say that I'm going to limit my development to HTML and CSS, heavens no. But for **this** in particular, I have decided to take the opportunity to learn how to center o div.
